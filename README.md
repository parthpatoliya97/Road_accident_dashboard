# 🚗 Road Accident Analysis (2021–2022)

### 🎯 Brief Project Info :-
- I built a Road Accident Analysis (2021–2022) using Excel, combining interactive charts, pivot tables, slicers, and KPIs.

- The report highlights critical patterns in accident severity, vehicle involvement, road infrastructure, weather conditions, and monthly trends.

- The final dashboard offers a clear, data-driven approach to reducing casualties and saving lives.

## 📍 Key KPI & Severity Highlights

| Severity Type | Count | % Share |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Slight** | 351,793 | 84.2% |
| **Serious** | 59,356 | 14.2% |
| **Fatal** | **6,734** | **1.6%** |

**Key Insight:** Even though fatal cases are only 1.6%, the absolute number (**6,734**) is significant and alarming.

## 📈 Casualties Monthly Trend (2021–2022)

* Both years follow a similar trend, with **higher casualties during summer (May–July)**. This indicates seasonal patterns where traffic volume may be higher during holidays or favorable weather.
* **November shows a peak** in 2021 (~21k casualties).
* 2022 shows a **drop in December (13.2k)**, indicating some improvement.
* Casualties in most months for 2022 are **slightly lower** compared to 2021.

## 💡 6. Recommendations to Reduce Accidents

1.  **🚦 Improve Road Infra on Single Carriageways :** Add dividers, speed enforcement, improve signage, and widen roads in high-traffic zones.
2.  **🚗 Target Car Drivers with Awareness Programs :** Focus on speeding, mobile usage, overtaking rules, and strict implementation of seatbelt policies.
3.  **🏙 Urban Congestion Management :** Implement better traffic signal synchronization, dedicated lanes for buses & two-wheelers, and increased traffic patrols during peak hours.
4.  **☀ Daytime Enforcement :** Since most accidents occur in daylight, deploy more traffic personnel and set up AI-based speed cameras.
5.  **🛑 Seasonal & Monthly Monitoring :** Provide extra supervision in **May–July & October–November** (identified peak months).
6.  **🚧 Introduce Real-Time Hazard Alerts :** Use mobile apps & smart signboards for instant hazard communication.
7.  **🧯 Community Awareness & Training :** Launch defensive driving programs, offer first-aid training for drivers, and run "No Phone While Driving" campaigns.
