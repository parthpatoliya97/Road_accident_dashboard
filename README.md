## 💡 6. Recommendations to Reduce Accidents

Based on the data-driven insights, the following actions are recommended for stakeholders:

1.  **🚦 Improve Road Infra on Single Carriageways:** Add dividers, speed enforcement, improve signage, and widen roads in high-traffic zones.
2.  **🚗 Target Car Drivers with Awareness Programs:** Focus on speeding, mobile usage, overtaking rules, and strict implementation of seatbelt policies.
3.  **🏙 Urban Congestion Management:** Implement better traffic signal synchronization, dedicated lanes for buses & two-wheelers, and increased traffic patrols during peak hours.
4.  **☀ Daytime Enforcement:** Since most accidents occur in daylight, deploy more traffic personnel and set up AI-based speed cameras.
5.  **🛑 Seasonal & Monthly Monitoring:** Provide extra supervision in **May–July & October–November** (identified peak months).
6.  **🚧 Introduce Real-Time Hazard Alerts:** Use mobile apps & smart signboards for instant hazard communication.
7.  **🧯 Community Awareness & Training:** Launch defensive driving programs, offer first-aid training for drivers, and run "No Phone While Driving" campaigns.
